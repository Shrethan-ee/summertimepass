// This file is the JavaScript equivalent of Django's `manage.py`.
// In a Node.js/Express application, there isn't a single direct equivalent to `manage.py`.
// Its functionalities (like running the development server, migrations, creating superusers, etc.)
// are typically handled by separate scripts, npm/yarn commands, or dedicated CLI tools.

// For example:
// - Running the development server: `node server.js` (where server.js is your main application file)
// - Database migrations: Handled by ORM/ODM specific CLI tools (e.g., `npx sequelize db:migrate` for Sequelize,
//   or custom scripts for Mongoose).
// - Creating superusers/managing users: Would be done via API endpoints or dedicated admin scripts.
// - Running tests: `npm test` or `yarn test` using a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.

// This file serves as a conceptual placeholder to indicate where `manage.py`'s responsibilities
// would be distributed in a JavaScript project.

// This file is the JavaScript equivalent of Django's `asgi.py`.
// In a Node.js application, ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is not directly applicable.
// Asynchronous operations are typically handled using Node.js's built-in async/await features
// and frameworks like Express.js which are inherently non-blocking.

// This file serves as a conceptual placeholder to indicate where ASGI's responsibilities
// would be distributed in a JavaScript project, primarily in how the server handles
// asynchronous requests (e.g., WebSockets, long-polling).

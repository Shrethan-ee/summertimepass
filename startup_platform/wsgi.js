// This file is the JavaScript equivalent of Django's `wsgi.py`.
// In a Node.js application, WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) is not directly applicable.
// Node.js applications typically use their own HTTP server implementations (e.g., built-in `http` module,
// or frameworks like Express.js) and are run directly by Node.js, often behind a reverse proxy like Nginx.

// This file serves as a conceptual placeholder to indicate where WSGI's responsibilities
// would be distributed in a JavaScript project, primarily in how the application interfaces
// with a web server.

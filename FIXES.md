# Backend Issues and Improvements

## Issues Identified:

1. **Missing JWT_SECRET**: The JWT_SECRET environment variable was missing from the .env file, which would cause JWT token generation to fail.

2. **Database Connection Issues**: The server.js file imports Sequelize models but the database connection and model associations are not properly set up.

3. **Missing Database Initialization**: The database tables are not being created/synced on startup.

4. **Field Name Mismatches**: The User model uses snake_case field names (first_name, last_name) but the serializer expects camelCase (firstName, lastName).

5. **Missing Error Handling**: Several endpoints lack proper error handling for database operations.

6. **Incomplete Server File**: The server.js file is truncated and missing the final app.listen() call.

7. **Missing Route for Root Path**: The server returns "Cannot GET /" because there's no route defined for the root path.

## Improvements Made:

1. Added JWT_SECRET to .env file
2. Fixed field name mismatches in serializers
3. Added proper database initialization
4. Added root route for health check
5. Improved error handling
6. Fixed server startup issues

## Next Steps:
- Complete the server.js file
- Set up proper database associations
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Test all endpoints

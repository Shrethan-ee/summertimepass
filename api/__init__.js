// This file is the JavaScript equivalent of Django's `__init__.py`.
// In Python, `__init__.py` files are used to mark directories as Python packages.
// In JavaScript, there is no direct equivalent for this purpose. Module imports
// are typically handled using `require()` or `import` statements based on file paths.

// This file serves as a conceptual placeholder to indicate the original Python package structure.

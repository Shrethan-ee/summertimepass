// This file is the JavaScript equivalent of Django migrations.
// In a Node.js application, database migrations are typically handled by ORM/ODM specific tools
// (e.g., Sequelize migrations for SQL databases, or custom scripts for NoSQL databases like MongoDB).

// This file serves as a conceptual placeholder to indicate where database schema changes
// would be managed in a JavaScript project.

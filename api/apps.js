// This file originally defined the Django application configuration for the 'api' app.
// In a Node.js/JavaScript environment, there isn't a direct equivalent to Django's AppConfig.
// Application-specific configurations and signal handling (like the import of api.signals)
// would typically be managed through direct module imports, initialization logic in your main
// application file (e.g., app.js or server.js), or using event emitters/middleware patterns.

// Original Django AppConfig details:
// - default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
// - name = 'api'
// - The `ready` method imported `api.signals` to register signal handlers.

// In a JavaScript project, you would ensure that any equivalent 'signal' or event listeners
// are properly imported and registered when your application starts up.

// This file originally contained Django admin configurations for the Python backend.
// In a JavaScript environment, there isn't a direct equivalent to Django's built-in admin interface.
// Management of data would typically be handled through API endpoints and a separate frontend administration panel.
// Therefore, this file serves as a placeholder to acknowledge the original functionality.

// Original Django models managed by this admin file:
// - Category
// - Tag
// - Idea
// - Like
// - Comment

// In a JavaScript application, you would typically build an admin UI using a frontend framework
// (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) that interacts with your backend API (e.g., Node.js with Express)
// to perform CRUD operations on your data models.
